FOCUS: World Model Decision-Time Objective Alignment for Natural-Language-Constrained Planning in Mixed-Initiative Human–Machine Teaming.

The tasks that this can be validated for me fall under 3 core regimes:
Safe Embodiment Planning Under Uncertainty (MBRL/MPC in our case)This is where the mobile manipulation came in Language instruction following, safety compliance and human given language constraints is Mixed Initiative HMT, and where all the NeSy work integrates.
Co-creation (voxel representation world generation + co-adaption with co-agent evolution). This is the planning MI task where the goal is actual co-construction.
Video Generation World Model Benchmarks My proposed framework can dream and improve through offline application to existing World Models via Self Play and Self Improvement with/without adaptive PEFT.
The primary concept generally in this direction I am introducing is to use energy-based causal world modeling and imagination (MPC rollouts Dyna style, possible I2A combination). Curiosity, curriculum learning, LUPI, etc. all stack in when oriented around this unifying axis. ORBIT is a first novelty towards this by treating entire segments of the rollout trajectory as a trajectory-level energy functional defined over the same offline learned dynamics path distribution, and then selecting actions by inference/reranking that optimizes this unified objective (dynamics credibility/coherence + return-to-go + any constraint/predicate terms), rather than exploiting local one-step prediction errors under selection pressure.

I’ll email the team with draft updates and WorldScore experiments (hopefully) validating ORBIT claims tomorrow. 

My hard target is to have v1 of the main experimental results and draft ready this week for team review, so we have ~1.5 weeks before the ICML abstract deadline for revisions and remaining ablations.

(prior also shared today with advisor so direction is locked in)
