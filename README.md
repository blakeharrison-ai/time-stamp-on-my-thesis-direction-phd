Co-Creative, Intent-Aligned World Modeling for Mixed-Initiative Human–Machine Teaming

## Validation Regimes (3)
- Safe Embodiment Planning Under Uncertainty (MBRL/MPC in our case)  
  - This is where the mobile manipulation came in.  
  - Language instruction following, safety compliance, and human-given language constraints form the Mixed-Initiative HMT setting, and this is where all the NeSy work integrates.

- Co-creation (voxel representation world generation + co-adaption with co-agent evolution)  
  - This is the mixed-initiative planning task where the goal is actual co-construction.

- Video Generation World Model Benchmarks  
  - My proposed framework can dream and improve through offline application to existing world models via self-play and self-improvement, with/without adaptive PEFT.

## Core Technical Concept
- The primary concept generally in this direction I am introducing is to use energy-based causal world modeling and imagination (MPC rollouts, Dyna style, possible I2A combination).  
- Curiosity, curriculum learning, LUPI, etc. all stack in when oriented around this unifying axis.  
- ORBIT is a first novelty towards this by treating entire segments of the rollout trajectory as a trajectory-level energy functional defined over the same offline learned dynamics path distribution, and then selecting actions by inference/reranking that optimizes this unified objective (dynamics credibility/coherence + return-to-go + any constraint/predicate terms), rather than exploiting local one-step prediction errors under selection pressure.

---

## Near-Term Plan
- I’ll email the team with draft updates and WorldScore experiments (hopefully) validating ORBIT claims tomorrow.  
- My hard target is to have v1 of the main experimental results and draft ready this week for team review, so we have ~1.5 weeks before the ICML abstract deadline for revisions and remaining ablations.

Note: prior also shared today with advisor so direction is locked in.
