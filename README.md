Research safe:

FOCUS: Human-Machine Teaming: Safe Language Guided Control and Self Play + Emergence (single + multiagent mobile manipulation (including Visual Navigation) | later lifelong meta learning and self improvement  + Co-Creation

Offline from language labeled video to Online MBRL Planning

BHFDD
ICARUS
Markovian Sets + Gibbs Fields
Various EBM strategies

Reactive Diffusion Systems + Synergetics and Dissipative Structures + Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with concepts of: Dynamical Systems (ODE/PDE Models) + Evolutionary Models and Artificial Life (ALife)

Full on Game Theory and Emergence
Co-Creation full on classical PCG integration
Full evolution strategies
Full on memory hierarchy advancements (e.g. Differential neural computer + NTMs + Transformers)

NeRF, Gaussian Splatting, Neural Voxel Renderer
Neural Marching cubes / dual contouring / implicit -> mesh bridges

All this with hybrid generative AI focus integrations (normalizing flows, GANs, Diffusion, etc.)

Need also to look at different losses and planning paradigms more deeply + NeSy methods integration:

ASP, HTN, ANML


Safe Emergent Equilibria in Multi-Agent Systems in Human-Machine Teaming

Path:

safe language-guided (PbRL) HMT + emergent equilibria + offline-to-online MBRL + causal energy-based world models (mobile manipulation (including visual navigation) + co-creation for improved world model learning)
